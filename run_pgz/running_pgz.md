These instructions are taken from the Pygame Zero website. For the latest information check [https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ide-mode.html](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ide-mode.html)

## Running Pygame Zero code with the **mu** editor

This is the simplest way to run code with Pygame Zero. When you have written and saved your code in the *mu* editor window click on the ***Mode*** button at the top left and choose the option "Pygame Zero":

![mu editor Pygame Zero mode](../Images/mu_pgz.png)

Click "OK" then click on the button marked *Play* to run your code. A Pygame Zero Game window will open:

![mu editor Pygame Zero running](../Images/mu_pgz_running.png)

To stop your code either kill the Pygame Zero window by clicking the red cross, or click the *mu* Stop button.

## Running Pygame Zero code with a full stand-alone Python installation

The method of running code with Pygame Zero has changed, so you may need to use a different procedure depending on what version of Pygame Zero you have.

### If you are running Pygame Zero version 1.2 or more recent
